# Active structural packet — Ice Climbers (Popo + Nana follower entity)

## Objective

Add Ice Climbers (external char, internal kinds FTKIND_POPO 10 / FTKIND_NANA 11) to the supported
domain. Unlike every prior port, one player slot owns TWO fighter entities: Nana is spawned
alongside Popo by the already-imported `Player_80031AD0` follower branch and is driven by the
retail CPU input block (AI type 6: record Popo's pads into a 30-slot ring, play back 5 frames
delayed, with follow/approach fallback). The packet has four owners: the character/article
sources, the fighter-axis widening of match/observation/compare state, the CPU input subsystem
slice, and follower-frame validation.

## Final boundary

- **Final owner (entities):** the imported `src/melee/pl/player.c` dual-entity machinery
  (`player_entity[2]`, `ftMapping_list[CKIND_POPONANA]`, `Player_8003248C` returning
  `Gm_PKind_Cpu` for the non-transforming second entity) becomes live. The runtime stops assuming
  fighters ≡ players: `MslCoreMatch` tracks per-player leader and follower fighters; every
  consumer that iterates fighters walks both entities of a slot.
- **Final owner (Nana's brain):** the retail CPU input path. `ftCo_800A2040` (headless stub
  `false` today) becomes the real predicate; the reachable AI slice — `ftCo_800B3900` tick chain,
  `ftCo_800B101C` type-6 think, `ftCo_800B0918`/`ftCo_800B0AF4` ring record/playback,
  `ftCo_800A589C` partner getter, command-execution helpers, and the `ftcpuattack.c` slice the
  type-6 graph reaches — is ported into the existing `src/runtime/ftco_0A01.c` projection or a
  full upstream import (decide at import time by measuring the reachable closure; upstream TU is
  NonMatching, so every ported function is verified against `refs/melee` asm individually).
- **Canonical state:** Nana's input state is `Fighter.x1A88` (`Fighter_x1A88_t`, 0x57C, already in
  `types.h`) exactly as retail — no hosted mirror, no synthesized controller lane. Inputs from the
  wire stay 4-wide per player; Nana never reads `HSD_PadGameStatus` and never touches the UCF pad
  ring (retail-natural: the AI branch skips the physical-pad block in
  `Fighter_Spaghetti_8006AD10`).
- **Consumers:** fighter creation/respawn (`scalar.c` bootstrap, `match.c` respawn), post-frame
  refresh, native DAT preload (already iterates entity 0..1), observation/output lanes, savestate
  copy, viewer live schema, and validation compare all address (player, entity∈{leader,follower}).
- **Displaced code/state:** the entity-0-only assumptions in `scalar.c:1074`/`:1804` (fighters[] =
  index 0, kept only for the Sheik/Zelda swap); the `ftCo_800A2040` false stub and the
  `ftCo_800B3900` abort row in `src/stubs/headless_exclusions.c`/`ledger.tsv`; validation's
  leader-only descent in `tools/validation/native.c:load_player`.
- **Deletion boundary:** no compatibility flag for "ICs without Nana", no synthesized Nana input
  lane in the wire format, no duplicate Nana state outside `Fighter`/`StaticPlayer`. The public
  input API stays `players[4]`; the observation/compare structs gain follower lanes in one cut
  (Python dtypes, native.c, wire.h move together).

## Sequencing (each step gates green before the next)

1. **Data plumbing:** `PlPp`/`PlNn` prefixes + `EfIcData.dat` in `tools/data/extract.py` and
   `raw.py`; re-extract from `./SSBM.iso`; manifest/test counts.
2. **Character packet (compile + spawn):** import 8 Matching chara TUs (`ftPopo/*.c` ×5,
   `ftNana/*.c` ×3) + 3 Matching article TUs (`itclimbersice/blizzard/string.c`), ftdata.c hosted
   registry rows, native DAT translation rows, `derive_gameplay_parts_mask.py` rows for both
   kinds, effect bank, char id 10 through core enums (public API admission deferred to step 5).
   `source_character_kind` maps id 10 → `CKIND_POPONANA` (first 1→2 expansion).
3. **Fighter-axis widening:** leader+follower fighter tracking in `MslCoreMatch`, respawn/death
   (`gm_80167320(slot, subchar)` already wired), UCF gate, savestate, observation lanes.
4. **CPU slice port:** un-stub `ftCo_800A2040`, port the type-6 reachable closure, asm-verify per
   function (NonMatching upstream).
5. **Validation + suite:** follower descent in `native.c` (peppi `ports.P{n}.follower`), follower
   compare lanes and life-cycle row carry (rows vanish while Nana is dead), public API/python/
   viewer admission, stage the icies suite (11 usable candidates in
   `~/SSBM/Replays/Samples/top14.zip`: FD/BF/YS/FoD/DL ×2 each; both PS games non-frozen,
   excluded), container aggregate gate.

## Evidence and acceptance

- Retail behaviors that must fall out of the port, not be re-implemented: Popo death kills Nana
  (`ftCo_800BFD9C`); belay partner tether (`checkNanaInRange`, rope item 113); squall sync
  (`ftNn_Init_80123954` kinematic slaving); Nana's percent-derived CPU level
  (`min(popo_percent/20, 9)`); Nana motion-table fallback to Popo (`ftData_80085FD4`).
- Acceptance: container aggregate stays 0 fail with all previously-passing replays byte-stable;
  icies suite validates with follower rows compared; full pytest green; no wire-format second cut.

## Log

- 2026-07-27 — `retained` (step 2)
  Scope: character packet committed as 5d0d3858 (11 TUs, registry rows, DAT translation, parts
  masks, extraction, effect bank 14, preload with Nana costume coverage).
  Evidence: native-smoke green including the Popo parts row; triage harness steps ICs-vs-Fox 600
  frames, Nana spawns as player_entity[1] and idles. One native delta (ledger
  nana-anim-leader-share-native): the ftData_80085CD8/E50 leader-share branch is excluded under
  MSL_CORE_NATIVE (x59C never materializes natively; x14 keys the same immutable subarchive).
  UCF finding: msl_ucf_apply_pad_buffer sits in the COMMON input path mirroring retail hook
  0x8006B460, so Nana running it is retail-faithful — no gate needed once the CPU predicate is
  real.
  Next: CPU TU import (ftCo_0A01.c + ftcpuattack.c wholesale, projection reconciliation,
  stub triage) — delegated; then fighter-axis lanes and follower validation.

- 2026-07-27 — `retained` (steps 3-5 infrastructure)
  Scope: CPU TU import committed (14de9dc2); follower compare lanes cut through
  wire.h/scalar/native.c in one step (MslCoreCompare 1022→1302, 28 follower lanes + presence);
  peppi follower descent with independent life-cycle row indexing (rows null during Nana's
  Sleep, resume at Popo's respawn — measured); ICs article registry rows fixed in items.c (NULL
  state-table segfault); public API/python/viewer admission; 12-replay icies suite staged.
  Evidence: container aggregate 183/63/0 under the new wire with all 247 output locks
  re-recorded; icies suite runs end-to-end (12/12, zero errors, four-climber ditto included),
  every entry diverging at frames 83-204 in follower lanes — the untuned Nana start-of-match AI
  decision stream.
  Next: Nana AI fidelity (retail probe of the x1A88 decision stream at the first divergence,
  fd-falco @-39 class), then classify/lock the suite and wire it into the aggregate.

- 2026-07-27 — `retained` (first Nana fidelity seed)
  Scope: session 2 traced the universal frames-83..204 follower divergence to the hosted UCF
  pad-buffer injection: it replaced Nana's AI stick with the port's cardinal-snapped raw pad and
  double-shifted the ring. The real gecko wraps its whole body in !Player_IsCPU, and Player_IsCPU
  IS ftCo_800A2040 (GALE01r2 map) — the predicate the CPU import made real.
  Evidence: with the one-line gate, container icies prefixes moved 83-204 → 95-1,416
  (medium-sheik: 21s of bit-exact two-climber play); aggregate unchanged (gate is vacuous for
  humans). Next layer, all classic per-mechanism families: itclimbersice SendItemInfo misc lanes
  (192/0 vs 64/255 @-27 bf-falco), 1-ULP Nana pos_x @98 fd-falco (fusion site), a crouch-mimic
  action pick @26 bf-falco.

- 2026-07-27 — `open`
  Scope: surveys complete (decomp map + sim architecture map, two Explore agents).
  Evidence: dual-entity player machinery already compiled in and inert; CPU predicate stubbed
  false; validation reads only `ports.P{n}.leader`; UCF pad ring would double-shift if Nana took
  the pad path. Nana's AI is type 6 (mimic ring + follow), NOT the general CPU tree; reachable
  slice bounded inside NonMatching `ftCo_0A01.c` + `ftcpuattack.c`.
  Disposition: proceed with sequencing above; step-2 import is mechanical (all 11 chara/article
  TUs are Matching upstream).
